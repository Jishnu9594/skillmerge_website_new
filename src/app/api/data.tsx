The classes were super interactive, and we worked on real challenges instead of just reading slides. I also loved how the instructors shared their own real-world experience, which helped me understand what it’s like to work in the industry. By the end of the course, I not only gained skills but also a lot of confidence",

We didn’t just sit in a classroom—we actually worked with tools like Burp Suite, Kali Linux, and Wireshark. I also learned how to think like a hacker (ethically, of course), which helped me understand security better. The trainers were friendly and explained things clearly, no matter how many times I asked. Today, I feel ready to apply for cybersecurity jobs, and I even started doing small freelance work thanks to what I learned here.",

We worked on actual scenarios like investigating attacks or finding security bugs. The environment was friendly, and I felt motivated throughout the course. The best part is that they don’t just teach — they guide you on how to build a career in cybersecurity. I’ve already started applying for internships and have even cleared a few interviews",

          Hacking means getting into computers, phones, or networks â€” sometimes
          in a good way, and sometimes in a bad way. Bad hackers try to steal
          information or break things. But ethical hackers use their skills to
          find and fix problems before bad hackers can attack. At SkillMerge, we
          teach ethical hacking to help protect people and companies from cyber
          threats.
